                    Public stigma refers to the negative assumptions and discriminatory behaviors society holds towards
                    people with mental illness or mental disorders. This includes rejection, prejudice, or exclusion,
                    such as being denied work or housing because tof their condition. These attitudes come from others
                    and this contrivutes to the widespread marginalization.
                </p>
                <p>Public stigma comes from the harmful stereotypes that society attaches to people with mental health
                    conditions. When individuals are labeled as ‚Äúdangerous,‚Äù ‚Äúunreliable,‚Äù or ‚Äúincapable,‚Äù it leads to
                    discrimination in daily life. Victims may face rejection from employers, difficulty finding safe
                    housing, or even being avoided in social situations. This constant mistreatment isolates people,
                    reinforcing the idea that they do not belong or cannot contribute meaningfully to their community

                    Self-stigma happens when individuals with mental illness or struggles take in society's negative
                    view of them due to their condition. They apply these negative views onto themselves, making them
                    feel ashamed, guilty, or unworthy, which can lower their confidence and hope. This internalized
                    stigma can discourage people from seeking help or pursuing goals that they are capable of achieving.
                </p>
                <p>Someone who believes they are weak, unworthy, or incapable may avoid
                    seeking help, withdraw from relationships, and stop pursuing goals. This cycle of shame erodes
                    self-esteem and hope, leaving victims trapped in feelings of guilt and failure. Over time, the
                    weight of
                    these internalized beliefs can make recovery and personal growth much harder, even if support is
                    available.</p>

                    Structural stigma is built into systems and institutions, where policies and practices, either
                    international or not, can create unequal opportunities for people with mental illness. For example,
                    mental health services often receive less funding compared to other health care services, making it
                    harder for people to access the care that they need.
                </p>
                <p>Self-stigma develops when people internalize society‚Äôs negative stereotypes and begin to see
                    themselves
                    through that distorted lens. Someone who believes they are weak, unworthy, or incapable may avoid
                    seeking help, withdraw from relationships, and stop pursuing goals. This cycle of shame erodes
                    self-esteem and hope, leaving victims trapped in feelings of guilt and failure. Over time, the
                    weight of
                    these internalized beliefs can make recovery and personal growth much harder, even if support is
                    available.</p>
