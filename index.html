                -`‚ô°¬¥- overview -`‚ô°¬¥-: Mental health stigma remains a widespread issue, affecting how people with mental
                health conditions are treated and how they view themselves. This page provides a discussion of what
                stigma is, why it matters, and how it impacts individuals and society.

                <h2>
                    Hello! ‚Çç·ê¢. .·ê¢‚Çé
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope you're not struggling mentally or emotionally,
                    because I know how painful that can be. Having problems with oneself and battling
                    our own demons feels absolutely awful, especially when those struggles involve
                    mental disorders or illnesses. The best way to deal with these challenges is by
                    speaking with a professional to understand what you‚Äôre going through and to
                    receive proper guidance. But when speaking with a professional isn‚Äôt enough,
                    or if you can‚Äôt seek professional help, then the next best thing is to support
                    yourself in other ways. First, work toward having a clear understanding of your
                    situation and use that awareness to help yourself improve on your own terms.
                    Second, confide in someone you trust so that you won‚Äôt feel alone and helpless
                    during your darkest moments. Whether it‚Äôs a friend or a family member, it‚Äôs always
                    best to have a trusted confidant to share your emotions with.
                </p>

        <div class="parent2">
            <div class="child">
                <p class="remember">While it‚Äôs also important to remember that while sharing your emotions with truste
                    people can be healing, you should be cautious about who you open up to. Sadly, not everyone will
                    respond with empathy, and some may judge you unfairly because of your mental state. Unjust stigma
                    still exists, and it can be especially painful for those already struggling with mental illnesses.
                    Many people living with these challenges already feel as though they don‚Äôt fit in or aren‚Äôt
                    ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù and negative comments or dismissive attitudes only deepen that personal heartache. This is
                    why surrounding yourself with understanding, compassionate people is essential so that your openness
                    is met with support rather than judgment.</p>

                <p>A lot of people suffering with mental health and a concerning amount of those
                    individuals are our youth. Even though those individuals already have to carry the burden of
                    thinking that something is wrong with them, it doesn't help that society encourages their negative
                    thoughts and osctrasizing them. Most haven't even graduated high school and yet they feel as though
                    they are struggling to carry the weight of their complex emotions which disrupts their daily life.
                    Most often than not, those individuals get professional help and get diagnosed with mental health
                    illnesses or disorders, but those who can't afford professional help or those who don't seek out
                    help would never know what the issue with their mental state is so they live the rest of their lives
                    in the dark, listening to the stigma and negative comments from society </p>

                <h2>What exactly is stigma?</h2>
                <p>Stigma refers to the negative beliefs, attitudes, and stereotypes that people have against
                    people with mental health conditions. Discrimination toward people living with mental
                    incapabilities, osctrasizing them.
                </p>
                <p>The word stigma itself means a mark, stain, or blemish. Applied to mental health, it describes the
                    way people are unfairly labeled or stereotyped based on their symptoms or diagnosis.</p>

                <p>Because of stigma, many people hesitate to seek treetment out of fear of being judged, losing
                    opportunities, or being treated differently. Whether it shows up openly or in subtle ways, stigma
                    harms people by reducing access to care and isolating them from support.</p>

                <p>Those living with mental illness often face stigma. They may be seen in a negative light, treated
                    differently, or made to feel embarrassed or ashamed about their condition. Stigma can also result in
                    discrimination at work, in school, or in social situations which is further worsening their
                    struggles.</p>
